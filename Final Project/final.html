            Solar system, assemblage consisting of the Sun—an average star in the 
            Milky Way Galaxy—and those bodies orbiting around it: 8 (formerly 9) 
            planets with about 210 known planetary satellites (moons); countless 
            asteroids, some with their own satellites; comets and other icy bodies; 
            and vast reaches of highly tenuous gas and dust known as the interplanetary medium.
        </p>

        <p>
            Located at the centre of the solar system and influencing the motion of all 
            the other bodies through its gravitational force is the Sun, which in itself 
            contains more than 99 percent of the mass of the system. The planets, in order 
            of their distance outward from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, 
            Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Four planets—Jupiter through Neptune—have ring systems, 
            and all but Mercury and Venus have one or more moons. Pluto had been officially listed 
            among the planets since it was discovered in 1930 orbiting beyond Neptune, but in 1992 
            an icy object was discovered still farther from the Sun than Pluto. Many other such 
            discoveries followed, including an object named Eris that appears to be at least 
            as large as Pluto. It became apparent that Pluto was simply one of the larger 
            members of this new group of objects, collectively known as the Kuiper belt. 
            Accordingly, in August 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU),
            the organization charged by the scientific community with classifying 
            astronomical objects, voted to revoke Pluto’s planetary status and 
            place it under a new classification called dwarf planet.

            Sun, star around which Earth and the other components of the solar system revolve. 
            It is the dominant body of the system, constituting more than 99 percent of its entire mass. 
            The Sun is the source of an enormous amount of energy, a portion of which provides Earth with 
            the light and heat necessary to support life. The radius of the Sun, R☉, is 109 times that of Earth, 
            but its distance from Earth is 215 R☉, so it subtends an angle of only 1/2° in the sky, roughly the 
            same as that of the Moon. The mass of the Sun, M☉, is 743 times the total mass of all the planets in the 
            solar system and 330,000 times that of Earth. All the interesting planetary and interplanetary gravitational 
            phenomena are negligible effects in comparison to the force exerted by the Sun. Under the force of gravity, 
            the great mass of the Sun presses inward, and to keep the star from collapsing, the central pressure outward 
            must be great enough to support its weight. The density at the Sun’s core is about 100 times that of 
            water (roughly six times that at the centre of Earth), but the temperature is at least 15,000,000 K, 
            so the central pressure is at least 10,000 times greater than that at the centre of Earth, which is 3,500 
            kilobars. The nuclei of atoms are completely stripped of their electrons, and at this high temperature they 
            collide to produce the nuclear reactions that are responsible for generating the energy vital to life on Earth.

        <p>
            The eight planets can be divided into two distinct categories on the basis 
            of their densities (mass per unit volume). The four inner, or terrestrial, 
            planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—have rocky compositions and densities 
            greater than 3 grams per cubic cm. (Water has a density of 1 gram per cubic cm.) 
            In contrast, the four outer planets, also called the Jovian, or giant, planets—Jupiter, 
            Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are large objects with densities less than 2 grams per cubic cm; 
            they are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium (Jupiter and Saturn) or of ice, rock, hydrogen, 
            and helium (Uranus and Neptune). The dwarf planet Pluto is unique—an icy, low-density body smaller 
            than Earth’s Moon, more similar to comets or to the large icy moons of the outer planets than to any 
            of the planets themselves. Its acceptance as a member of the Kuiper belt explains these anomalies.

        <p>
            <img src="/earth.jpg" alt="" height="300px"><br><br>
            Earth, third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest planet in the solar system in terms of 
            size and mass. Its single most outstanding feature is that its near-surface environments are 
            the only places in the universe known to harbour life. 
            Earth’s name in English, the international language of astronomy, derives from Old English 
            and Germanic words for ground and earth, and it is the only name for a planet of the solar 
            system that does not come from Greco-Roman mythology.
        </p>

        <p>
            Earth’s surface is traditionally subdivided into seven continental masses: 
            Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. 
            These continents are surrounded by four major bodies of water: the Arctic, Atlantic, 
            Indian, and Pacific oceans. However, it is convenient to consider separate parts of 
            Earth in terms of concentric, roughly spherical layers. Extending from the interior 
            outward, these are the core, the mantle, the crust (including the rocky surface), 
            the hydrosphere (predominantly the oceans, which fill in low places in the crust), 
            the atmosphere (itself divided into spherical zones such as the troposphere, where 
            weather occurs, and the stratosphere, where lies the ozone layer that shields Earth’s 
            surface and its organisms against the Sun’s ultraviolet rays), and the magnetosphere 
            (an enormous region in space where Earth’s magnetic field dominates the behaviour of 
            electrically charged particles coming from the Sun).

        <p>
            <img src="/moon.jpg" alt="" height="300px"><br><br>
            Moon, Earth’s sole natural satellite and nearest large celestial body. Known since prehistoric times, 
            it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun.
            The Moon’s desolate beauty has been a source of fascination and curiosity throughout history and 
            has inspired a rich cultural and symbolic tradition. In past civilizations the Moon was regarded 
            as a deity, its dominion dramatically manifested in its rhythmic control over the tides and the 
            cycle of female fertility. Ancient lore and legend tell of the power of the Moon to instill spells 
            with magic, to transform humans into beasts, and to send people’s behaviour swaying perilously between 
            sanity and lunacy (from the Latin luna, “Moon”).
            Centuries of observation and scientific investigation have been centred on the nature and origin of 
            the Moon. Early studies of the Moon’s motion and position allowed the prediction of tides and led to 
            the development of calendars. The Moon was the first new world on which humans set foot; the information 
            brought back from those expeditions, together with that collected by automated spacecraft and remote-sensing 
            observations, has led to a knowledge of the Moon that surpasses that of any other cosmic body except Earth itself.
