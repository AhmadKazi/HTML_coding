                Doraemon (Japanese: ドラえもん Japanese pronunciation: [do̞ɾa̠e̞mõ̞ɴ]) is a Japanese manga series written 
                and illustrated by Fujiko Fujio, the pen name of the duo Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko. The series
                 has also been adapted into a successful anime series and media franchise. The story revolves around 
                 an earless robotic cat named Doraemon, who travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a boy 
                 named Nobita Nobi.

            Doraemon is sent back in time by a young boy named Sewashi Nobi to improve the circumstances of his 
            great great grandfather, Nobita, so that his descendants may enjoy a better future. In the original 
            timeline, Nobita experienced nothing but misery and misfortune manifested in the form of very poor grades 
            and bullying throughout his life. This culminates in the burning down of a future business he sets up which 
            leaves his family line beset with financial problems. In order to alter history and better the Nobi family's
            fortunes, Sewashi initially wanted to send a super-robot to protect Nobita, but with his meager allowance he 
            could only afford an imperfectly-made factory-rejected toy: an anthropomorphic robot cat called Doraemon.
            Doraemon was originally conceived by Hiroshi Fujimoto following a series of three events. When searching for
             ideas for a new manga, he wished a machine existed that would come up with ideas for him, he tripped over his 
             daughter's toy, and heard cats fighting in his neighborhood.

    <div class="paras">
        <p class="Ps p1">
            The name "Doraemon" can be translated roughly to "stray." Unusually, the name "Doraemon" (ドラえもん) is written in a
            mixture of two Japanese scripts: Katakana (ドラ) and Hiragana (えもん). "Dora" derives from "dora neko" (どら猫, stray cat), 
            and is a corruption of nora (stray),[4] while "-emon" (in kanji 右衛門) is an old-fashioned suffix for male names (for example, 
            as in Ishikawa Goemon).
        </p>

        <p class="Ps">
            Doraemon was created on 3 September 2112 by the Matsushita Robot Factory (マツシバロボット工場).[5] He has a fourth-dimensional 
            pocket (四次元ポケット) from which he produces food, money, medicines, and desserts from the future. The 1995 film shows his original 
            appearance; when first created Doraemon had ears and was painted yellow, but he turned blue after sobbing because rats ate his ears. 
            According to 2112: The Birth of Doraemon, he is coated and scented with eggs.

        <p class="Ps">
            In 2008 the character of Doraemon was appointed as an "anime ambassador" to help promote Japanese anime worldwide and in 2013 Doraemon was 
            considered to be the most popular character among Japanese children in a survey held by Video Research Ltd, a position the character had held 
            in the survey since June 2009.[18][19] On The Wall Street Journal's Japan Real Time, Toko Sekiguchi called it "arguably the most beloved cartoon 
            character in Japan".[20] Google Japan utilized Doraemon in its Google Doodle for 3 September 2009, in celebration of the character's 40th birthday.
        </p>

        <p class="Ps">
            In terms of popularity the character has been compared to Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse,[10][11][12] and the character is considered to be an iconic figure in Japan. 
            The character has received criticism in Chinese media outlets where they considered Doraemon to be a politically subversive character and that it was a tool of Japan's 
            “cultural invasion". In 2019, a resolution was made in the Pakistan assembly to ban Doremon claiming that it has "harmful impact on children".[16] In his book Japan Pop: 
            Inside the World of Japanese Popular Culture, author Timothy J. Craig wrote that the character of Doraemon "Though Doraemon is himself a high-tech product, he possesses an 
            endearing personality that captivates young audiences. He is both a full member of Nobita's family and an intimate friend to Nobita and his companions. Portrayed in this way, 
            Doraemon represents the optimistic view of the relationship between technology and humanity.
