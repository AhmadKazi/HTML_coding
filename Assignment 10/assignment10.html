            Lamb is a type of red meat that comes from young sheep. Not only is it a rich source of high-quality protein, but it is also an outstanding source of many vitamins and minerals, including iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. Because of this, regular consumption of lamb may promote muscle growth, maintenance, and performance.

        <h3 class="two"> <b>Chicken</b> </h3>
        <p class="p2">
            Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Chicken generally includes low fat in the meat itself. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein.
